        AngularJS is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework mainly maintained by Google and by a
        community of individuals and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing
        single-page applications. It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by
        providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectures,
        along with components commonly used in rich Internet applications.
